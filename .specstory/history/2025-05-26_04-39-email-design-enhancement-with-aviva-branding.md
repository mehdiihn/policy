3. **Brand-consistent Colors** (yellow header, blue overlay, blue content sections)
4. **Compelling Messaging** that reinforces the policy completion

This creates a much more engaging and professional email experience that combines Aviva's brand elements with real human imagery, making the insurance communication feel more personal and trustworthy. The banner adds visual interest while maintaining the professional corporate aesthetic.

I tried sending an email the banner doesn't load only the images of the logo loads

_**Assistant**_

The issue is that many email clients don't support background images in CSS. Let me fix this by converting the banner to an actual `<img>` tag instead of a CSS background image. This will ensure it loads properly in all email clients.

---



---

Now let me update the sub-admin email template with the same fix:

---



---

Perfect! I've fixed the banner image loading issue in both email templates. Here's what I changed:

## üîß **Email Client Compatibility Fix:**

### üìß **Problem Solved**
- **Issue**: CSS background images don't load in many email clients (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- **Solution**: Converted to actual `<img>` tag which is universally supported

### üñºÔ∏è **New Banner Implementation**
- **HTML Image Tag**: Now uses `<img src="https://s6.imgcdn.dev/Y6dAhL.webp">` instead of CSS background
- **Better Compatibility**: Works in all email clients including Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail
- **Proper Alt Text**: Added descriptive alt text for accessibility
- **Maintained Styling**: Kept the same overlay and text positioning

### üé® **Visual Consistency**
- **Same Appearance**: The banner looks identical but now loads reliably

### ‚ö° **Technical Improvements**
