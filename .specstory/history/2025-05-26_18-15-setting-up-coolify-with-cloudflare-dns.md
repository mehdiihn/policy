# Setting Up Coolify with Cloudflare DNS (2025-05-26 21:15:18)

_**User**_

if I host this on coolify but my domain is on cloudflare ns how do I setup so that it uses the lets encrypt from coolify with nixpacks ignore @COOLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md 

---

_**Assistant**_

When hosting on Coolify with a domain managed by Cloudflare nameservers, you need to configure things properly to use Coolify's Let's Encrypt SSL certificates. Here's how to set it up:

## 1. Cloudflare DNS Configuration

In your Cloudflare dashboard:

1. **Set DNS Records to "DNS Only" (Gray Cloud)**
   - Go to your Cloudflare DNS settings
   - Find your A record pointing to your Coolify server IP
   - Click the orange cloud icon to turn it gray (DNS Only)
   - This disables Cloudflare's proxy and lets Coolify handle SSL directly

2. **Add A Record**
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @ (for root domain) or subdomain
   Content: Your Coolify server IP address
   Proxy status: DNS only (gray cloud)
   TTL: Auto
   ```

## 2. Coolify Domain Configuration

In your Coolify application settings:

1. **Add Your Domain**
   - Go to your application in Coolify
   - Navigate to "Domains" section
   - Add your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com` or `app.yourdomain.com`)

2. **Enable SSL/TLS**
   - Coolify will automatically attempt to generate Let's Encrypt certificates
   - Make sure "Generate SSL Certificate" is enabled
   - Coolify will handle the ACME challenge since Cloudflare is in DNS-only mode

## 3. Cloudflare SSL/TLS Settings

To avoid conflicts:

1. **Set SSL/TLS Mode to "Off" or "Flexible"**
   - Go to SSL/TLS â†’ Overview in Cloudflare
   - Set encryption mode to "Off" (since Coolify will handle SSL)
   - Or use "Flexible" if you want some Cloudflare features

2. **Disable Cloudflare SSL Features**
   - Turn off "Always Use HTTPS" (let Coolify handle redirects)
   - Disable "Automatic HTTPS Rewrites"

## 4. Alternative: Use Cloudflare for DNS + Coolify for SSL

If you want to keep some Cloudflare features:

1. **Use "Full" SSL Mode**
   - Set Cloudflare SSL/TLS to "Full" (not "Full (strict)")
   - This allows Cloudflare to proxy while Coolify provides the origin certificate

2. **Configure Origin Certificates**
   - You can use Cloudflare's origin certificates on Coolify
   - But Let's Encrypt is simpler and works well with DNS-only mode

## 5. Verification Steps

After configuration:

1. **Check DNS Propagation**
   ```bash
   nslookup yourdomain.com
   dig yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **Test SSL Certificate**
   - Visit your domain in a browser
   - Check that the certificate is issued by Let's Encrypt
   - Verify there are no mixed content warnings

3. **Monitor Coolify Logs**
   - Check deployment logs for any SSL generation issues
   - Look for Let's Encrypt challenge completion

## 6. Nixpacks Deployment Settings

For your Nixpacks deployment, ensure:

```env
# In Coolify environment variables
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

And in your application settings:
- **Port**: 3000
- **Start Command**: `next start`
- **Build Command**: (leave empty, Nixpacks handles it)

## Recommended Approach

The simplest and most reliable setup is:

1. **Cloudflare**: DNS-only mode (gray cloud)
2. **Coolify**: Handle SSL with Let's Encrypt
3. **Benefits**: 
   - Automatic SSL renewal
   - No proxy conflicts
   - Direct connection to your server
   - Full control over SSL configuration

This setup gives you the reliability of Cloudflare's DNS with the simplicity of Coolify's SSL management.

@pdfProcessor.ts instead of putting the generated time as a new row , just put it next to the startDate and endDate

So it looks like 24 May 2024 - 19:04 

25 May 2024 - 19:04 representing the ukTime value

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the PDF processor to include the generated time next to the start and end dates instead of having it as a separate row.

---

Read file: src/lib/pdfProcessor.ts

---

Now I need to modify the code to format the UK time to show just the time (HH:MM) and append it to the start and end dates. Let me make the necessary changes:

---



---

Now I need to update the table styling logic since we removed one row (the "Document generated" row). Let me check the current styling logic and update it:

---

Read file: src/lib/pdfProcessor.ts

---

Perfect! The changes have been successfully applied. Now the PDF will show the time appended to both the start and end dates in the format you requested. Here's what was changed:

1. **Modified the UK time format**: Changed from showing full date and time to just showing the time in HH:MM format (24-hour format)

2. **Updated the fields array**: 
   - Removed the separate "Document generated" row
   - Modified "Start of cover" to show: `{formatted date} - {time}` (e.g., "24 May 2024 - 19:04")
   - Modified "End of cover" to show: `{formatted date} - {time}` (e.g., "25 May 2024 - 19:04")

3. **Maintained existing styling**: The table styling logic automatically adapts since we removed one row, and the "End of cover" row (which is now the last row) will still get the light blue highlight.

The result will be that both the start and end dates will display with the current UK time appended, showing exactly when the document was generated, in the format you specified: "24 May 2024 - 19:04" and "25 May 2024 - 19:04".

@page.tsx Allow the users to download their said policies with the download buttton using the @pdfProcessor.ts 

Just like in the @route.ts  for admins but now from the user perspective so he can download his own pdf

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you implement the download functionality for users to download their own policy PDFs. I need to create an API endpoint for users to download their policies and then connect it to the download button.

First, let me create the API endpoint for users to download their policy:

---

```diff
- 
+ import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
+ import connectToDatabase from "@/lib/mongodb";
+ import Policy from "@/lib/models/Policy";
+ import { pdfProcessor } from "@/lib/pdfProcessor";
+ import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
+ 
+ export async function GET(
+   request: NextRequest,
+   { params }: { params: { id: string } }
+ ) {
+   try {
+     await connectToDatabase();
+ 
+     // Get the token from cookies
+     const token = request.cookies.get("token")?.value;
+ 
+     if (!token) {
+       return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
+     }
+ 
+     // Verify the token
+     const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET!) as any;
+ 
+     if (decoded.role !== "user") {
+       return NextResponse.json({ error: "Forbidden" }, { status: 403 });
+     }
+ 
+     const policyId = params.id;
+ 
+     // Fetch the policy and ensure it belongs to the authenticated user
+     const policy = await Policy.findOne({
+       _id: policyId,
+       userId: decoded.userId,
+     })
+       .populate("userId", "fullName email address dateOfBirth")
+       .populate("createdBy", "fullName email")
+       .lean();
+ 
+     if (!policy) {
+       return NextResponse.json(
+         { error: "Policy not found or access denied" },
+         { status: 404 }
+       );
+     }
+ 
+     // Generate the policy document
+     const documentBuffer = await pdfProcessor.generatePolicyDocument(
+       policy as any
+     );
+ 
+     // Return the PDF as a downloadable file
+     return new NextResponse(documentBuffer, {
+       status: 200,
+       headers: {
+         "Content-Type": "application/pdf",
+         "Content-Disposition": `attachment; filename="Policy Certificate ${policy.policyNumber}.pdf"`,
+         "Content-Length": documentBuffer.length.toString(),
+       },
+     });
+   } catch (error) {
+     console.error("Error downloading policy:", error);
+     return NextResponse.json(
+       { error: "Internal server error" },
+       { status: 500 }
+     );
+   }
+ } 
```

---

Now let me update the user policy detail page to implement the download functionality:

---



---

Now I need to add the `handleDownloadPolicy` function to the component:

---



---

Perfect! Now let me also add a loading state to the download button to provide better user feedback:

---



---



---



---

Perfect! Now I've successfully implemented the download functionality for users. Here's what I've added:

## Summary of Changes:

### 1. **New API Endpoint** (`src/app/api/user/policy/[id]/download/route.ts`)
- Created a secure endpoint that allows users to download their own policy PDFs
- Includes authentication to ensure users can only download their own policies
- Uses the same `pdfProcessor` that admins use
- Returns the PDF as a downloadable file with proper headers

### 2. **Updated User Policy Detail Page** (`src/app/user/policy/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Added `isDownloading` state for better UX
- Implemented `handleDownloadPolicy` function that:
  - Fetches the PDF from the API endpoint
  - Creates a blob and triggers automatic download
  - Handles the file download in the browser
  - Includes proper error handling
- Updated the download button to show loading state
- Added visual feedback with spinner and "Downloading..." text

## Key Features:

1. **Security**: Users can only download their own policies (verified by JWT token and user ID matching)

2. **User Experience**: 
   - Loading state with spinner
   - Disabled button during download
   - Automatic file download with proper filename
   - Clean up of temporary URLs

3. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for network issues or unauthorized access

4. **Consistency**: Uses the same PDF generation logic as the admin email functionality, ensuring consistent document format

The download button will now work exactly like the admin functionality, but from the user's perspective, allowing them to download their own policy certificates as PDFs with the same professional formatting that includes the updated time format we implemented earlier.
