Project Overview: Fake Insurance App (for demonstration purposes)

The app will have two main user roles: Admin and Sub-Admin.

🔒 Admin Portal
 • Full access to the system.
 • Can create and manage Sub-Admins and Users.

🔐 Sub-Admin Portal
 • Can create User accounts only.
 • Will have access to a form to enter user and policy details:
 • Full Name
 • Email
 • Password
 • Address
 • Date of Birth
 • Vehicle Registration
 • Last 4 digits of credit card
 • Policy Price

📄 After Sub-Admin Creates a Policy
 • A user account is automatically created.
 • A confirmation email is sent to the user with a PDF certificate showing their policy details.

📱 User App/Portal
 • Users can log in to view their:
 • Vehicle details
 • Insurance policy status and duration

The main page / should be a login screen

then the app should have 3 sections
/admin
/sub-admin
/user

based on the account that is logging in it should be redirected accordingly

The users should be able to see all the data needed for 

The raport that is sent as the pdf to the customer should have similar data to this one:

I'll help you build a comprehensive fake insurance app with Next.js, ShadCN, TailwindCSS, MongoDB, and Auth.js. Let me start by exploring the current workspace and then set up the project structure.

---

Tool call timed out after 5s (list files)

---

Let me try a different approach and check what's in the workspace:

---

```bash
dir
```

```
PS D:\test policy gen\policy-gen> dir

I can see there's already a Next.js project set up with ShadCN configured. Let me check the current project structure:

---

```bash
ls -la
```

```
PS D:\test policy gen\policy-gen> ls -la
