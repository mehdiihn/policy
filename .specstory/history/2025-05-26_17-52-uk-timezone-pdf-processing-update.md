@pdfProcessor.ts  Here add the exact time when the pdf is processed but make sure its from the UK timezone not the server timezone where we will host the website

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add the exact time when the PDF is processed, using UK timezone. I'll modify the PDF processor to include this information in the policy details table.

Perfect! I've added the exact time when the PDF is processed to the policy details table. Here's what I've implemented:

1. **UK Timezone**: The code uses `timeZone: "Europe/London"` which automatically handles both GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) and BST (British Summer Time) depending on the date.

2. **Comprehensive Time Format**: The timestamp includes:
   - Date: Day, month (full name), year
   - Time: Hours, minutes, and seconds in 24-hour format
   - Example output: "25 January 2025, 14:30:45"

3. **Added to Policy Table**: The timestamp appears as "Document generated" in the policy details table, so users can see exactly when their certificate was created.

The `toLocaleString()` method with the `Europe/London` timezone ensures that regardless of where the server is hosted, the time displayed will always be accurate UK time, automatically adjusting for daylight saving time transitions.
