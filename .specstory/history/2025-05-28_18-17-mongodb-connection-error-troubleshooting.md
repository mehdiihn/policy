What mongodb uri do I need to set

mongodb://root:ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H@t48k8o048wwo400okog0w0sc:27017/?directConnection=true

since this is what I get from coolify

# npm run seed
npm warn config production Use `--omit=dev` instead.

> policy-gen@0.1.0 seed
> node scripts/seed.js

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your error, the issue is with the MongoDB URI format. The URI you got from Coolify is missing the database name in the connection string.

Your current URI:
```
mongodb://root:ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H@t48k8o048wwo400okog0w0sc:27017/?directConnection=true
```

Should be updated to include the database name (`insurance-app`) like this:

---



---

Let me check the current content and make the correct update:

---

Read file: .env.local

---

I see the issue now. Your current `.env.local` file already has the correct format with the database name (`insurance-app`), but the URI you mentioned from Coolify is missing it. You need to update your MongoDB URI to match the format that's currently in your `.env.local` file.

The correct MongoDB URI you should use is:

```
mongodb://root:ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H@t48k8o048wwo400okog0w0sc:27017/insurance-app?directConnection=true
```

The key difference is adding `/insurance-app` before the query parameters. This specifies which database to connect to, which is required for authentication to work properly.

In your Coolify environment variables, make sure you set:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H@t48k8o048wwo400okog0w0sc:27017/insurance-app?directConnection=true
```

The authentication error occurs because MongoDB needs to know which database to authenticate against, and without specifying the database name in the URI, it defaults to the `admin` database, which doesn't have the user credentials you're trying to use.

mongodb://root:ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H@t48k8o048wwo400okog0w0sc:27017/insurance-app?directConnection=true

Well this is what we currently have

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right, that's exactly what you currently have in your `.env.local` file. Since you're still getting the authentication error with that URI, let's try a few troubleshooting steps:

1. **First, let's test the connection without the database name** to see if the credentials work at all:

---

```diff
  # MongoDB Connection
- MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H@t48k8o048wwo400okog0w0sc:27017/insurance-app?directConnection=true
+ MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H@t48k8o048wwo400okog0w0sc:27017/?directConnection=true
  
  
```

---

Now try running the seed script again:

---

```bash
npm run seed
```

---

Let me also try a few other potential solutions. The issue might be:

1. **Authentication database**: MongoDB might need to authenticate against the `admin` database. Let's try:

---

```diff
  # MongoDB Connection
- MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H@t48k8o048wwo400okog0w0sc:27017/?directConnection=true
+ MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H@t48k8o048wwo400okog0w0sc:27017/insurance-app?directConnection=true&authSource=admin
  
  
```

---

This URI now includes `authSource=admin` which tells MongoDB to authenticate the user against the `admin` database (where root users are typically stored) while connecting to the `insurance-app` database.

Try this version:
```
mongodb://root:ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H@t48k8o048wwo400okog0w0sc:27017/insurance-app?directConnection=true&authSource=admin
```

If this doesn't work, we can also try:

2. **Without specifying a database** (authenticate to admin and let the app create/use the database):
```
mongodb://root:ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H@t48k8o048wwo400okog0w0sc:27017/?directConnection=true&authSource=admin
```

3. **Check if the credentials are correct** - sometimes Coolify generates different credentials than what's shown in the UI.

Would you like to test the current URI with `authSource=admin`, or would you prefer to try one of the other approaches?

how do I find the mongodb database and how do I connect it from the ubuntu terminal of coolify

---

_**Assistant**_

To find and connect to your MongoDB database from the Coolify Ubuntu terminal, follow these steps:

## 1. Access the Coolify Terminal

First, you need to access the terminal of your MongoDB container in Coolify:

1. Go to your Coolify dashboard
2. Navigate to your MongoDB service/container
3. Look for a "Terminal" or "Console" button to access the container's shell

## 2. Connect to MongoDB from the Terminal

Once you're in the MongoDB container terminal, you can connect using the `mongosh` (MongoDB Shell) command:

---

```bash
echo "Here are the commands you'll need to run in the Coolify MongoDB terminal:"
```

```
PS D:\test policy gen\policy-gen> echo "Here are the commands you'll need to run
 in the Coo
lify MongoDB terminal:"
           PS D:\test policy gen\policy-gen>

```

---

In the **Coolify MongoDB container terminal**, run these commands:

### Option 1: Connect with the root user
```bash
mongosh --host localhost --port 27017 --username root --password ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H --authenticationDatabase admin
```

### Option 2: Connect without specifying auth database first
```bash
mongosh mongodb://root:ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin
```

## 3. Once Connected, Check Available Databases

After successfully connecting, run these MongoDB commands:

```javascript
// List all databases
show dbs

// Check current database
db

// Switch to your insurance-app database (create if doesn't exist)
use insurance-app

// List collections in current database
show collections

// Check if there are any users in the database
db.users.find().limit(5)
```

## 4. Create the Database and User (if needed)

If the `insurance-app` database doesn't exist or you need to create a specific user for it:

```javascript
// Switch to insurance-app database
use insurance-app

// Create a user specifically for this database
db.createUser({
  user: "insurance-user",
  pwd: "your-password-here",
  roles: [
    { role: "readWrite", db: "insurance-app" }
  ]
})

// Or grant the root user access to this database
db.grantRolesToUser("root", [{ role: "readWrite", db: "insurance-app" }])
```

## 5. Alternative: Check MongoDB Logs

You can also check the MongoDB logs in Coolify to see what's happening during authentication:

1. In Coolify, go to your MongoDB service
2. Check the "Logs" tab to see any authentication errors

## 6. Test Connection from Your App

Once you've verified the database exists and the user has proper permissions, try these MongoDB URI variations in your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Option 1: With authSource=admin
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H@t48k8o048wwo400okog0w0sc:27017/insurance-app?directConnection=true&authSource=admin

# Option 2: Without specifying database (let app create it)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:ZWilyXveBLl3hCciSMiXa2kpPJCUqF2aFDnjck5VF3XR27vvDlawEnlYwTKBF39H@t48k8o048wwo400okog0w0sc:27017/?directConnection=true&authSource=admin

# Option 3: If
